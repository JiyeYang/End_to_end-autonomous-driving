# End_to_end-autonomous-driving
An easy example of End-to-end autonomous dring by using images captureed by the front camera outputs the steering angle, torque and speed.
Datasets: Udacity(Ch3_001)
You need to extract the images and the labels of the steering angle, torque and speed from the initial format ROSbag of the dataset.
